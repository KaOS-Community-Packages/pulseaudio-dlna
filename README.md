A lightweight streaming server which brings DLNA / UPNP and Chromecast support to PulseAudio and Linux

Additional python packages required by pulseaudio-dlna installed under ~/.local.

<b>NOTE!</b>
<i>pulseaudio-dlna seems abandoned, and hasn't been updated for several years. It also uses python2, which has reached EOL. Consider using PulseAudios own modules instead (zerozonf/RAOP and paprefs).</i>

<h2>Installation</h2>

kcp -i pulseaudio-dlna
